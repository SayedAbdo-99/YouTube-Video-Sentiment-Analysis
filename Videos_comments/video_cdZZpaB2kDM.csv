Watching history happen in real time is quite a privilege. I love that they make this freely available.,positive
I truly enjoyed getting to know Elon more.  Thank you for such a great talk.,positive
Elon is really his true self. He speaks honestly with no filters. I love it.,positive
“The WHY of things is very important” - Elon Musk. This was an incredible interview to watch. Elon you’re incredible.,positive
wonderful that Elon is so earnestly about what he says and guts to expose himself  and also about the importance of truth and speech - it´s rare in those days. Bless you Elon,positive
Humanity is lucky to have Elon Musk.,Negative
"His obsession for truth is equally as impressive as his remarkable focus and persistence.  “When someone you don’t like says something you don’t like, you have freedom of speech”… Elon Musk",positive
"The most revolutionary aspect of this man is his desire, and ability, to speak to honesty and integrity.
Normally we just expect to hear hype and PR bulldust from businessmen of his status but he seems perfectly happy to just cut that crap out and leave it behind in the junk pile of history.",positive
Thank you Elon for all of your efforts,Negative
Super inspired by the interview. Gave me a meaning to live longer. I strongly believe humans are headed for something super Big Bang again.! Thank you Elon you are a Visionary.,Negative
"I used to be self-conscious about my stuttering problem, but seeing Elon comfortable in his skin and achieve the success he has is truly inspiring. My favorite talk of his to date.",positive
"Fist time watching a Musk interview, pleasant surprise. A very intelligent, committed man, with great sense of humour.",positive
Agree with most that has already been said. Love Elon and very thankful for all he does. I think he wants to help mankind above all else. Wealth is a cosequence.,Negative
Great conversation. I have a lot of admiration for you Elon. You are extraordinarily brilliant man. Planet Earth is lucky to have you. I admire your passion and dedication to solve problems. Thank you for your humanism. Your son  is cute 🙏❤️❤️🙏,positive
Elon is the best. I appreciate him so much!,positive
"This really expanded my view of Elon Musk, seeing how sensitive he is to the difficulties we face and yet how stubbornly hopeful he is that we can build a better world. You can feel it really matters to him. We need more of this optimism and principle in the people we allow to dictate the path of our future. I wish him well.",positive
i think my mind would crumble if I spent one day in his head haha so grateful for being able to watch him to show us what humans are capable of.. genius!!,Negative
Thank you TED for giving us this in-site into the thinking of Elon Musk !  👍👍👍👍👍 🇺🇸🦅,Negative
I would say after listening to enough of elon's interviews that at my age I finally found someone who's on a path which I can actually stand behind Elon for president,positive
thank you for take time to tell us about your works Elon Musk.,positive
"It's good to hear Elon Musk talk about his enemies in stark, blunt terms. Different from his competitors whom he treats with amusement, but respect. An important distinction.",positive
I find him so inspiring. We need more hard working minds like his.,positive
I love this guy. Elon is amazing.,positive
There should be more people with the values of Elon Musk. We need a sustainable future now,Negative
Elon is the man. It's nice to hear someone with a logical mindset.,positive
"Elon hit me to the heart with what he said, ""You want the future to be something to look forward to. Not to wake up and feel sad about.""

It is hard to wake up and not feel sad for me, since I got stage 5 kidney disease. The medical aide where I live is a big company that cares more for a dollar than actually helping patient who can afford to pay, they bully the weak and sick and it adds suffering. The stories I could share on this. I am stuck in my condition, but hearing Elon say that and listening to him here made tears well up. For you see Mr. Musk, I lost all hope for humanity and felt sad for those that will be left behind after this disease takes me. But those words and seeing how deep you felt when you spoke.... It hit a spark of hope for my love ones after I am gone. If more people would hit or come up with ideas on how to solve the many issues that plague so many like: hospitals gouging pockets and actually care about their patients, and the homeless (there are vets out that fought for our country, children, the physically and mentally sick). And that is just a few issues. We need more Elon Musks with the will and power to change our world for humanity. 

If I wrote too much I am sorry. I only meant to say thank you Mr. Musk for doing what you are doing.",Negative
The algorithm being open source will teach him so much about consciousness. I hope Elon remains patient and cautious.,positive
"I loved how he said he loves humanity. We love you too, Elon.",positive
Imagine being one of the people who doesn’t understand how incredibly blessed we are to have Elon,positive
He’s very inspirational to people of all ages.,positive
"The fact he didn’t give up in the most excruciating experience of his life greatly proves his character.  In addition, the fact his company is the most shorted stock the history, further proves the greater control and corruption in the “free market”; we need more people arising with the courage, and tenacity of Elon to keep us free.  Thank you Elon! You are such an inspiration for us and for the next generation.",positive
Musk has done a lot lately.  He's earned my respect as a person.,Negative
"I respect Elon. He's so admirable that even if he were to screw up he'd say ""I screwed up. Let's fix it."" He has total control of his ego while at the same time has total confidence in the decisions he makes. He understands that some want him to fail and is intelligent enough to watch his back at all times. All whilst keeping things really simple while chaos surrounds him. When things speed up he doesn't panic. I think he slows things down in his mind and takes one thing at a time to find a solution. Very balanced mind. Total respect. I'd hire him to do any task. lol",positive
"This man is amazing, a true legend right here❤️🫱🏼‍🫲🏿.. Don’t give. Everyone can succeed❤️🫱🏼‍🫲🏿",positive
"Easily one of, if not THE brightest mind of our time. I feel so privileged to be able to listen to him speak. Thank you TED.",positive
"It's such a good idea to make Twitters algorithms open sourced, cuz otherwise even with technical free speech the owners could hide things.",Negative
elon is on point in this interview. Very clear and concise,Negative
YOUR COMPOSURE IS MAGNIFICENT…thank you for your consistency Elon.,positive
At right around 21:00 minutes I love what he says about free speech. It's like the majority of what he says is so profound.,positive
I actually find Elon Musk quite brilliant!,positive
What an interview- hearing Elon Musk's thinking process and his innovated vision is inspiring. Great job Chris Anderson,positive
"I genuinely don’t think there’s a single thing I could ask Elon that would make him surprised, he’s literally too smart",Negative
I wanted to meet Elon Musk someday to learn more about his experiences <3,positive
"I love Elon Musk very much & like many posting comments I’m in awe of him. Now while I don’t expect him to make his personal life public for us, because it’s really none of our business, I do however feel reminded of Steve Jobs & how brilliant & innovative & courageous & driven he was: and how his family suffered for it all. With all the moms in the picture for his several kids, it must be hard to find living situations that allow him to be present with all of them. At the end of his life he may not have accomplished every great thing in his mind although he will have accomplished many. I hope he has no regrets about possible time spent with his kids.",positive
to be able to speak with and listen to a visionary of this magnitude is one of the luxuries of the information age that we take for granted. didn’t happen in the industrial revolution or previous epics in world history,positive
"""Life can't just be about solving one miserable problem after another, you gotta wake up in the morning and have something that you are excited for"" - Elon musk",Negative
How blessed we are to witness this man in our existence. Such a goal focused fresh mind. I hope your visions are successful!!,positive
"This is just excellent, a presentation of unique ideas along with mental wonderings and wanderings.   There is something immensely human about such conversations, sort of ""restore your faith in humanity"" emotion.   Great talk!",positive
Your videos are always the best💯 I do receive a notification each time you post a new video.. We'll have regrets for things we did not participate in...Investment should always be on any creative man's heart for success in life.,Negative
Elon ideas are always powerful. He got some moving ideas.☺️,positive
